=== .ai/actions rules ===

## App/Actions guidelines

- This application uses the Action pattern and prefers for much logic to live in reusable and composable Action classes.
- Actions live in `app/Actions`, they are named based on what they do, with no suffix.
- Actions will be called from many different places: jobs, commands, HTTP requests, API requests, MCP requests, and more.
- Create dedicated Action classes for business logic with a single `handle()` method.
- Inject dependencies via constructor using private properties.
- Create new actions with `php artisan make:action "{name}" --no-interaction`
- Wrap complex operations in `DB::transaction()` within actions when multiple models are involved.
- Some actions won't require dependencies via `__construct` and they can use just the `handle()` method.

@boostsnippet('Example action class', 'php')
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Actions;

final readonly class CreateFavorite
{
    public function __construct(private FavoriteService $favorites)
    {
        //
    }

    public function handle(User $user, string $favorite): bool
    {
        return $this->favorites->add($user, $favorite);
    }
}

=== .ai/code-quality rules ===

## Code Coverage

- Use `@codeCoverageIgnore` only in exceptional cases when code cannot be tested (e.g., code that can't run in test environment like database deletion in tests).
- Prefer writing tests for all code paths including exception handling using mocks and `andThrow()`.

## PHPStan

- Do not use `@phpstan-ignore`, `@phpstan-ignore-line`, `@phpstan-ignore-next-line` or similar inline ignore comments.
- If PHPStan reports type errors, fix them properly with correct type annotations or refactor the code.

=== .ai/design rules ===

## Design System

Follow Notion-inspired minimalist design principles for all pages.

### Color Palette

- Background: `bg-white dark:bg-neutral-900`
- Cards/Sections: `bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-neutral-800` with `rounded-xl`
- Primary text: `text-neutral-900 dark:text-white`
- Secondary text: `text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400`
- Muted labels: `text-neutral-400 dark:text-neutral-500`
- Success/Accent: `green-500`, `green-600`
- Borders: `border-neutral-300 dark:border-neutral-600`

### Typography

- Headings: `text-lg` or `text-2xl` with `font-bold` or `font-semibold`
- Body text: `text-sm` (14px) with `leading-5`
- Small text/labels: `text-xs` (12px)
- Always use `font-medium` for interactive elements

### Spacing & Layout

- Page container: `max-w-2xl mx-auto px-4 py-6`
- Section spacing: `mb-6`
- Card padding: `px-4 py-2`
- Gap in flex: `gap-2`, `gap-3`

### Interactive Elements

- Hover states: Use `hover:bg-neutral-100 dark:hover:bg-neutral-800`
- Transitions: `transition-all duration-150` or `duration-200`
- Cursor: `cursor-pointer` on clickable elements
- Completed items: `opacity-60`, `line-through` on text

### Alignment Patterns

- Checkbox + text: Wrap checkbox in `h-5 flex items-center`, use `leading-5` on text
- Baseline alignment: Use `items-baseline` for mixed font sizes
- Fixed elements: Use `flex-shrink-0`

### Component Patterns

- Cards: `bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-neutral-800 rounded-xl px-4 py-4`
- Buttons: `px-3 py-1.5 text-xs font-medium rounded-full`
- Icon buttons: `w-10 h-10 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center`
- Empty states: Center with icon, title, and description

### Dark Mode

- Always provide dark mode variants using `dark:` prefix
- Test both modes visually
- Green shades invert: `green-600 dark:green-500`, `green-200 dark:green-900`

### Animations

- Animations must be smooth, subtle, and non-intrusive — they should enhance the user experience, not distract from it.
- Use entrance animations (`animate-fade-in-up`, `animate-stagger`) for content that appears on page load or state change.
- Use `transition-all duration-150` or `duration-200` for interactive feedback (hover, focus, toggle).
- Use Alpine `x-transition` for elements that show/hide dynamically (modals, dropdowns, banners).
- Use `x-collapse` for expandable/collapsible sections.
- Hover effects on small grid cells: `hover:scale-125` or `hover:scale-150` with `duration-150`.
- Never add animation to static informational elements that don't change (legends, table headers).
- Prefer CSS animations and Tailwind utilities over JavaScript-driven animations.
- Keep durations between 120ms–400ms. Anything longer feels sluggish.
- Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — use `motion-safe:` prefix when adding non-essential animations.

=== .ai/finalization rules ===

## Final Actions (🚨 CRITICAL - NEVER SKIP 🚨)

⚠️ **MANDATORY REQUIREMENT - YOU MUST DO THIS BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE COMPLETION:**

Before you finalize ANY task or tell the user you're done, you MUST:
1. **RUN: `vendor/bin/sail composer test`** to run ALL tests in the application.
2. **IF TESTS FAIL:** Fix ALL issues immediately. Do not ask the user - just fix them.
3. **ONLY AFTER 100% SUCCESS:** Confirm completion to the user.

**🛑 STOP AND RUN TESTS NOW 🛑** - If you haven't run `vendor/bin/sail composer test` yet, you are NOT done. Go back and run it.

=== foundation rules ===

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application running on PHP 8.5. Always use the APIs that match the installed major version of each package — do not assume a version.

Before relying on a package's API, confirm its installed version:
- PHP packages: run `vendor/bin/sail composer show --direct` to list direct dependencies with versions, or `vendor/bin/sail composer show <vendor/package>` for a single package.
- JS packages: check `package.json` for the installed versions.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If a frontend change doesn't show in the UI or you get a "Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, run `vendor/bin/sail bun run build` or ask the user to run `vendor/bin/sail bun run dev` or `vendor/bin/sail composer run dev`.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Use `search-docs` before changes that depend on Laravel ecosystem APIs, behavior, configuration, or version-specific syntax. Skip it for copy-only edits and other changes where package documentation is irrelevant. Reuse sufficient results already in context instead of searching again.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Project Rules

- This project contains committed, area-grouped rules in `.ai/rules` when that directory exists, including path-scoped framework guidelines under `.ai/rules/boost`. Before you enter plan mode or create/edit any file, you MUST first: open @.ai/rules/index.md (it maps file globs to rule files), read every rule file whose globs cover the path(s) in scope, and run `grep -rin 'keyword' .ai/rules` to catch what a path match alone misses. Do not write code until you have read and are following every matching rule. If `.ai/rules` does not exist, continue without it.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `vendor/bin/sail artisan route:list`). Use `vendor/bin/sail artisan list` to discover available commands and `vendor/bin/sail artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `vendor/bin/sail artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `vendor/bin/sail artisan config:show app.name`, `vendor/bin/sail artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `vendor/bin/sail artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `vendor/bin/sail artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== sail rules ===

# Laravel Sail

- This project runs inside Laravel Sail's Docker containers. You MUST execute all commands through Sail.
- Start services using `vendor/bin/sail up -d` and stop them with `vendor/bin/sail stop`.
- Open the application in the browser by running `vendor/bin/sail open`.
- Always prefix PHP, Artisan, Composer, and Node commands with `vendor/bin/sail`. Examples:
    - Run Artisan Commands: `vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate`
    - Install Composer packages: `vendor/bin/sail composer install`
    - Execute Node commands: `vendor/bin/sail bun run dev`
    - Execute PHP scripts: `vendor/bin/sail php [script]`
- View all available Sail commands by running `vendor/bin/sail` without arguments.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Add or update tests for behavior and logic changes when a test provides meaningful regression coverage.
- Pure copy, styling, and layout-only changes do not require new or updated tests.
- When test coverage applies, run the affected tests and ensure they pass.
- Test the changed behavior and its important failure modes, but do not add tests beyond them.
- Read the `testing-best-practices` skill before writing tests.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `vendor/bin/sail artisan list` and check their parameters with `vendor/bin/sail artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

=== laravel-octane/core rules ===

# Laravel Octane

This application uses Laravel Octane, a long-running PHP server. The application bootstraps once and handles many requests within the same process.

- Never store request-specific state in singletons or static properties, because it can leak across requests.
- Use `config('octane.server')` to detect the active driver (`swoole`, `roadrunner`, or `frankenphp`).
- Prefer scoped bindings (`$this->app->scoped()`) over singletons for per-request services.

When working on Octane-specific features (concurrency, shared tables, memory, driver configuration, testing), invoke `octane-development` for detailed rules.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allows you to build dynamic, reactive interfaces in PHP without writing JavaScript.
- You can use Alpine.js for client-side interactions instead of JavaScript frameworks.
- Keep state server-side so the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions as you would in HTTP requests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/sail bin pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/sail bin pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/sail bin pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

# Pest

- This project uses Pest. Create tests with `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Do not include the test suite directory in `{name}`. Use `SomeFeatureTest`, not `Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Read the `testing-best-practices` skill for guidance on coverage, naming, structure, dependency isolation, and review.
- Do not delete tests or test files without approval. They are part of the application.

## Running Tests

- Run the narrowest set of tests that covers the change. Pass a file path or `--filter=testName` to `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact`.
- Rerun a test after each change to it.
- Run `vendor/bin/sail bin pest` to call the test runner directly. It accepts the same file path and `--filter=testName` arguments.
- After the feature tests pass, ask the user to run the complete suite with `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact`.
